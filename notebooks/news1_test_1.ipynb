      "At least 20 people have been killed by deadly flooding in South Korea, as torrential rainfall continues to batter central regions.  A third day of downpours triggered landslides and caused a major dam in the central North Chungcheong province to overflow.  Heavy rain submerged roads, swept away cars and disrupted railways.  Another 10 people are missing and thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes, officials said.  Most of the casualties were reported from the North Gyeongsang province, caused by landslides in the mountainous area that destroyed homes. Entire houses \"were swept away whole\" in the most severely affected areas, an emergency responder told local media. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo has asked the military to assist with rescue efforts.  Authorities say 19 cars have been submerged in an underground tunnel in the central Chungcheong province  - prompting fears the number of fatalities could rise. Thousands of people have been affected by evacuation orders issued by various local governments.  Some 6,400 residents were evacuated after the Goesan Dam began to overflow at around 06:30 local time on Saturday (21:30 GMT on Friday), South Korean news agency Yonhap said.  A number of low-lying villages near the dam, as well as many of the roads connecting them, were said to have been submerged, leaving some residents trapped in their homes.  Korail, the country's national rail operator, has announced the suspension of all slow trains and some bullet trains, and said other bullet train services would be disrupted.  Late on Friday, a train was derailed in North Chungcheong after a landslide threw earth and sand onto the tracks.  One engineer was injured in the incident, but the train was not carrying passengers at the time.  The Korea Meteorological Administration forecast more rainfall through to Wednesday next week. It warned that the weather conditions pose a \"grave\" danger. Extreme rain has caused floods and landslides across several countries including India, China and Japan over the past fortnight. While many factors contribute to flooding, scientists say a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. The warmer it becomes, the more moisture the atmosphere can hold.\n",

      "A blistering US heatwave is forecast to intensify this weekend, with warnings issued across the south-west.  Heat advisories late on Friday affected at least 113 million Americans, from Florida to Texas to California, up to the north-western state of Washington. Air conditioner use in Texas has topped the state's previous record for power consumption as people try to keep cool. Around 27 million people are forecast to experience temperatures over 110F (43C) in the coming days.  The heat is a result of an upper level ridge of high pressure, which typically brings with it warmer temperatures, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. The agency added it is \"one of the strongest\" systems of its kind that the region has ever seen.    \"The subtropical ridge responsible for this likely historic heatwave across the region is not showing signs of letting up anytime soon,\" the NWS said. About 700 people are estimated to die each year from heat-related causes in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Saturday will also be exceptionally hot, with daytime highs forecast to hit up to 115F (46C) in some areas. The scorching heat is expected to linger until next week.  Phoenix is on course to break its longest hot spell record with the forecast for the next five days expected to hit or exceed 110F (43C).  The all-time record is 18 days and the city has already seen 15 days of 110F temperatures.  Las Vegas may match its all-time high of 117F (47C) in the next few days, while Death Valley, California - one of the hottest places on Earth - could surpass its official all-time high temperature of 130F (54C). The NWS in Las Vegas warned locals, who might think they can handle the temperatures, that this is \"not your typical desert heat\". They tweeted: \"'It's the desert, of course its hot'- This is a DANGEROUS mind set! This heatwave is NOT typical desert heat due to its long duration, extreme daytime temperatures, & warm nights. Everyone needs to take this heat seriously, including those who live in the desert.\" Parts of the south-western US have already grappled with intensely hot temperatures over the past week. In El Paso, Texas, temperatures have been in the triple-digits Fahrenheit for 27 consecutive days. Parks, museums, zoos and businesses have either announced closures or shortened hours because of the extreme heat.  The Bison Café in Quitaque, Texas, announced shorter hours, saying the scorching temperatures were making the kitchen \"very uncomfortable\" for cooks. Hospitals were also seeing heat-related admissions.  \"We're getting a lot of heat-related illness now, a lot of dehydration, heat exhaustion,\" said Dr Ashkan Morim, who works in the emergency room at Dignity Health Siena Hospital, outside of Las Vegas. Overnight temperatures were expected to remain \"abnormally warm\" in some areas, offering little night-time relief from the heat. Demand for power in Texas has surpassed record numbers for two days in a row because of the heat. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ECROT), which manages 90% of the power load in Texas, said its usage hit a preliminary 81,406 megawatts on Thursday, topping Wednesday's record of 81,351 megawatts.  ERCOT said it expects power usage on Friday to surpass those numbers, though the agency said it had enough resources to meet the demand.  The US heatwave mirrors similar searing conditions in Europe, which forced Greece to close one of its major tourist attractions, the Acropolis, on Friday.  Last week, the global average temperature was 63F (17.23C), the highest ever recorded. Scientists say the temperatures are being driven by climate change and the naturally occurring weather pattern known as El Niño, which happens every three to seven years and causes temperatures to rise. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.\n",

      "Title: Architect held in Long Island serial killer case\n",
      "Summary: Police say the married suspect in the long-unsolved Gilgo Beach murders is \"a demon that walks among us\".\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66190844\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "An architect has been charged over the deaths of three out of up to 11 victims in the Gilgo Beach murders in New York state over a decade ago.  Rex Heuermann, 59, is charged with killing Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. He is suspected in a fourth woman's death. On Friday the married Long Island father pleaded not guilty. Detectives say they matched DNA from pizza that the suspect ate to genetic material found on the women's remains. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison told a news conference on Friday: \"Rex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us - a predator that ruined families.\" The suspect, who was arrested at his home on Thursday night, is facing three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of second-degree murder in the three women's deaths. The judge in the case ordered that he remain in custody, citing the \"extreme depravity\" of the crimes.  After a plea was entered on his behalf in court, Mr Heuermann reportedly broke down in tears, telling his attorney: \"I didn't do this.\"  The lawyer, Michael Brown, said his client was \"distraught\" and called the evidence \"extremely circumstantial\".  \"We're looking forward to fighting this case in a court of law, not the court of public opinion,\" Mr Brown said.  Ms Barthelemy, Ms Waterman and Ms Costello were found dead in 2010 near a fourth victim, Maureen Brainard-Barnes.  The women have been dubbed the Gilgo Beach Four. All were sex workers, according to prosecutors.  Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told Friday's news conference that \"each of the four victims were found similarly positioned, bound in a similar fashion by either belts or tape, with three of the victims found wrapped in a burlap-type material\".  The local prosecutor said the case against Mr Heuermann was built on mobile phone records linking him to the victims, as well as to a pick-up truck that was seen near one of the victim's homes. He allegedly communicated with the victims using \"burner\" phones, which he later disposed of.  Phone records also allowed investigators to determine that the deaths had taken place when Mr Heuermann's wife and children were out of town.  Hair found on a piece of burlap used to wrap one of the victims was linked to Mr Heuermann via a sample from a pizza box he discarded in a rubbish bin in Manhattan in January 2023, according to authorities.  Investigators say he was also snared by taunting calls that a person claiming to be the murderer made to one of Ms Barthelemy's family members using her mobile phone. Ms Barthelemy was abducted in 2009. Ms Waterman and Ms Costello both went missing in 2010.  Mr Heuermann is also a prime suspect in the death of Ms Brainard-Barnes, who was abducted in 2007, although he has so far not been charged with her death. In 2010, police were searching for one missing woman, Shannan Gilbert, when they discovered the remains of four others.  Altogether, 11 sets of human remains were found on the same stretch of Gilgo Beach between 2010-11, linked to nine women, one man and a toddler. The identities of four, including the toddler, her mother and the man, remain unidentified.   Ms Gilbert's remains were eventually found, and an official post-mortem examination was inconclusive. Her family believes she may have been murdered - a theory supported by an independent autopsy that they commissioned.  A new task force to investigate the Gilgo Beach murders was formed in February 2022. Mr Heuermann became the focus of the investigation within a month, Mr Tierney said. More than 300 subpoenas and search warrants were issued by investigators on the case.  Since the task force was formed, Mr Heuermann allegedly also used a burner phone to conduct more than 200 searches about topics related to serial killers and the Long Island investigation. This included a search for \"why hasn't the Long Island serial killer been caught\" and \"mapping the Long Island murder victims\", court documents show.  Mr Tierney added that \"torture porn\" and \"depictions of women being abused and being killed\" were found on Mr Heuermann's computer.  The investigation into the other victims is ongoing. Mr Heuermann is the owner of RH Consultants and Associates, a Manhattan architecture firm that describes itself as \"New York City's premier architectural firm\".  The Associated Press has reported that he has a daughter and a stepson. A neighbour described the 6ft 4in suspect going to work every morning, dressed in a suit and tie and carrying a briefcase.  Mr Tierney said that Mr Heuermann had licences for 92 guns and a \"very large safe\" in which firearms were kept.  In a YouTube interview for a real estate-focused channel last year, he said he had been working in the heart of New York City since 1987, describing himself as a \"trouble shooter\". He added that his work helped teach him to \"understand people\".  People who lived near his home in Long Island's Massapequa Park expressed surprise at his arrest.  \"The guy's been quiet, never really bothers anybody,\" neighbour Etienne DeVilliers told CBS, the BBC's US partner. \"We're shocked. Because this is a very, very quiet neighbourhood. Everybody knows each other, all of our neighbours, we're all friendly.\" \n",

      "Summary: The industry's biggest shutdown since 1960 has already impacted major films and promotional events.\n",

      "Full Body:\n",
      "Jason Sudeikis, Susan Sarandon and thousands of other actors have joined screenwriters for Hollywood's biggest strike in more than six decades. Actors will not appear in films or even promote movies during the stoppage. Major films in production including the Avatar and Gladiator sequels may be affected by the shutdown. The actors are joining writers who walked out in May, concerned about pay, working conditions and the industry's use of artificial intelligence (AI). Brian Cox, the lead actor on HBO's Succession, told the BBC the strike could last \"until the end of the year\". \"The whole streaming thing has shifted the paradigm,\" the Scottish star told BBC Newscast. \"They are trying to freeze us out and beat us into the ground, because there's a lot of money to be made in streaming and the desire is not to share it with the writers or the performers.\" Talks for a new contract with studios and streaming giants broke down on Thursday, with the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) accusing the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) of being \"unwilling to offer a fair deal\". About 160,000 performers stopped work at midnight, joining the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), who walked out on 2 May. By noon on Friday, union members and their supporters had gathered outside the offices of major studios and streaming services in Los Angeles, New York and other cities. The demonstrations have received support from some of the biggest celebrities in the movie and television business, including the stars of the upcoming Oppenheimer movie, who walked off the red carpet on Thursday night. The two guilds want studios and streaming services to offer better pay, increased royalties, higher contributions to their pension and health plans, and safeguards on the use of AI in the industry. Productions likely to be affected include sequels to the Avatar, Deadpool and Gladiator franchises, as well as upcoming seasons of shows such as Stranger Things, Family Guy and The Simpsons. Red-carpet premieres, promotional interviews, and events including the Emmys and Comic-Con, have already been halted, rescheduled or scaled back.  The strike action is driven in part by an uncomfortable transition to the era of digital streaming, as well as by broader technological changes. \"AI will affect everybody,\" Academy Award winner Susan Sarandon told the BBC from a picket line in New York. \"There's definitely always been the feeling that if it isn't solved now, how do we ever solve it in the future?\" she said. \"If you don't have the foresight to put something in place for the future, then you're screwed. It's clear that nothing is going to change from the top down, it's going to be up to us at the bottom.\" Both writers and actors have complained that they make far less money than they used to make and that contracts have been undercut by inflation. For actors, pay for individual roles has declined, forcing them to seek several more roles to make the same amount of money as they did a few years ago. Writing contracts have become shorter and more perilous, with payment often not included for writers' work on revisions or new material. \"We are being victimised by a very greedy entity,\" Fran Drescher, the current SAG president, said on Thursday. \"I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us.\" The failed negotiations between the unions and the AMPTP marks the first tandem strike in the industry since 1960. The last actors' strike, in 1980, lasted 10 weeks. A third union, the Directors Guild of America (DGA), is not participating in the strike after successfully negotiating its own contract in June, but the group has said it \"strongly supports\" those who are picketing. With the prospect that the strike could roll on for months, cinemas could face problems, and viewers may be left with nothing new to watch bar reality TV and live sport. In a statement on Friday, the White House said President Joe Biden \"believes all workers - including actors - deserve fair pay and benefits\". \"The President supports workers' right to strike and hopes the parties can reach a mutually beneficial agreement,\" spokeswoman Robyn Patterson said. Actors represented by SAG's sister union in the UK - Equity - must continue to work as normal, due to UK employment laws. That includes stars of HBO's House of the Dragon. The union has however told US companies it will be keeping a \"very close eye\" on any attempts to move US productions to the UK.\n",

      "Summary: Health warnings for Rome and elsewhere come as extreme weather scorches southern and central Europe.\n",

      "Full Body:\n",
      "Red alerts have been issued for 16 cities across Italy as extreme heat continues to affect southern Europe.  The alerts, which indicate risks even for healthy people, apply to tourist hotspots including Rome, Florence, and Bologna for the coming days. More high temperatures are expected in Europe next week as another heatwave approaches. The European Space Agency (ESA) says Italy, Spain, France, Germany and Poland may see extreme conditions. The ESA monitors land and sea temperatures via its satellites.  Periods of intense heat occur within natural weather patterns, but globally they are becoming more frequent, more intense and are lasting longer due to global warming. The Italian government has advised anyone in the areas covered by Saturday's red alerts to avoid direct sunlight between 11:00 and 18:00, and to take particular care of the elderly or vulnerable.  Meanwhile, Greece has hit temperatures 40C (104F) or more in recent days. The Acropolis - the country's most popular tourist attraction - was closed during the hottest hours of Friday to protect visitors.  There are also fears in the country of a greater risk of wildfires, especially in areas with high winds. It suffered major wildfires in 2021 in another exceptional heatwave. High temperatures have also been reaching into central parts of Europe, with Germany and Poland among countries affected. Czech Republic's meteorological office issued a warning that temperatures over the weekend could go above 38C, which is exceptionally high for the country. In the UK, however, heavy showers and gusty winds are expected in parts of England on Saturday. Meteorologists said this was because the southern shift of the jet stream, which was fuelling the hot weather in Europe, was also drawing low-pressure systems into the UK - bringing unsettled and cooler weather. The current heatwave in Europe has been named Cerberus by the Italian Meteorological Society, after the three-headed monster that features in Dante's Inferno.  Italian weather forecasters are warning that the next heatwave - dubbed Charon after the ferryman who delivered souls into the underworld in Greek mythology - could push temperatures back up above 40C next week. Heatwaves are also being seen in parts of the US, China, North Africa and Japan. Greece's culture ministry announced the closure of the Acropolis on Friday from 12:00 to 17:00 (9:00-14:00 GMT), saying similar measures were likely to follow on Saturday. The complex sits on a rocky hilltop with little shade, and temperatures there are usually hotter than in the surrounding areas.  Several other tourist sites around the Sacred Rock where the Acropolis stands remained open throughout the day. In recent days, the Greek Red Cross has been deployed to provide water bottles and help people feeling nauseous and dizzy in the heat. People have been advised to drink at least two litres of water a day and to avoid coffee and alcohol, which are dehydrating.  Last month was the hottest June on record, according to the EU's climate monitoring service Copernicus. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Europe was 48.8C in Sicily in August 2021. Extreme weather resulting from warming climate is \"unfortunately becoming the new normal\", the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has warned.  How have you been affected by the extreme heat?

      "Title: Young firefighter dies in action during record blazes\n",
      "Summary: Devyn Gale, 19, was hit by a tree while at work during Canada's worst-ever wildfire season.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66209084\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "A 19-year-old firefighter has been killed in western Canada as the country battles its worst season of wildfires on record. Devyn Gale was struck by a falling tree while working in a remote area near the town of Revelstoke, British Columbia. Paying tribute, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described the news as \"heartbreaking\".  About 900 wildfires are currently burning across Canada, some 560 of which remain out of control. Officials said a female firefighter had been found caught under a tree after becoming separated from the rest of her team while clearing an area of brush.  She was airlifted to hospital but died on Thursday.  It marks the first death on the ground since the start of Canada's wildfire season - and reportedly the first in British Columbia since 2015.  In a tribute on Instagram identifying Ms Gale as the woman killed, brother Nolan Gale described her as an \"amazing sister\".  \"She was so kind and thoughtful. She was careful, considerate, hardworking,\" he wrote.   \"I'm grateful for everything she's done for me and others, completely out of kindness with no expectation for reciprocation.\" Writing on Twitter, Mr Trudeau sent his \"deepest condolences\" to Ms Gale's family, friends, and fellow firefighters. \"We must never forget the risks these heroes take every time they run toward the danger,\" he said. So far this season, wildfires have burned more than 9.8m hectares (24.2m acres) of land, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre.  The figure is higher than for any previous year on record and more than three times the average for the previous ten years.  British Columbia has been one of the worst-affected areas, with 365 active fires currently burning across the province, and on Thursday put out a call for help from an additional 1,000 international fighters.  Sarah Budd, spokesperson for the British Columbia Wildfire Service, has said conditions are expected to remain hot and dry for the foreseeable future.  \"We're not expecting any reprieve from the weather,\" she said. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.  Canada is estimated to be warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and in recent years has seen extreme weather events of increasing frequency and intensity. The wildfires have also sparked pollution alerts across North America as smoke is blown south along the continent's eastern coast.\n",

      "Title: Terms of Syrian aid offer unacceptable, says UN\n",
      "Summary: Syria had said it would continue to allow aid through a border crossing relied on by 4.1 million people.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66209143\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "The United Nations has described as \"unacceptable\" the conditions placed by Syria in an offer to allow aid to keep reaching rebel-held territory. Syria's ambassador to the UN said on Thursday his government would let aid continue entering the country via the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Turkey. Members of the UN Security Council had earlier failed to reach an agreement to keep the border crossing open. Some 4.1 million people in north-west Syria depend on the aid deliveries. In a letter to the UN secretary general, Syrian ambassador Bassam Sabbagh said Damascus had made a \"sovereign decision\" to let aid cross through Bab al-Hawa for the next six months. It would allow deliveries to resume \"in full co-operation and co-ordination with the Syrian government\", he said. But in a document sent to the Security Council and seen by the AFP and Reuters news agencies, the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the proposal \"contains two unacceptable conditions\". It said that, first, the Syrian government had \"stressed that the United Nations should not communicate with entities designated as 'terrorist'\". Since the start of Syria's civil war in 2011, President Bashar al-Assad has frequently described any rebel groups or opponents of his regime as terrorists.  The OCHA also said Damascus also wanted the distribution of all aid in northwest Syria to be supervised and facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). It said the condition was \"neither consistent with the independence of the United Nations nor practical, as the ICRC and SARC are not present\" in the area. However, it did say the Syrian government's offer could be a \"basis for the United Nations to lawfully conduct cross-border humanitarian operations via the Bab al-Hawa border crossing\". On Tuesday, Russia - a key ally of Syria's - used its veto on the Security Council to block a nine-month extension to the UN-brokered agreement allowing aid to move through Bab al-Hawa. Syria and Russia have previously objected to the UN aid delivery mechanism as a violation of Syria's sovereignty, But Russia was then unable to win enough support among the Council's 15 members for its favoured option of a six-month extension.  The US - which along with France and the UK had called for a one-year extension - accused Russia of \"an act of utter cruelty\". The offer from the Syrian government was met with concerns that Damascus could be able to control the distribution of aid, and stop it reaching opposition-held areas.   \"The priority needs to be getting aid flowing again, fast, to the people who need it - and then getting certainty over its future,\" UK ambassador Barbara Woodward said after Syria's announcement. \"But without UN monitoring, control of this critical lifeline has been handed to the man responsible for the Syrian people's suffering,\" she added. The Bab al-Hawa lifeline has become even more important since a devastating earthquake struck north-west Syria in February, killing more than 4,500 people and displacing 50,000 families. Despite the impasse over Bab al-Hawa, the UN is still able to use two additional aid crossings that were opened with the consent of the Syrian government following the earthquake until 13 August. \n",

      "Title: Canada city can halt indigenous murders blockade\n",
      "Summary: Protesters blocked the dump after officials said they would not search for the remains of two murdered women.\n",

      "A Canada court has allowed police to remove a blockade of a landfill site by protesters demanding action over the murders of two indigenous women. Demonstrators began blocking the entrance to the rubbish dump in Winnipeg, Manitoba, about a week ago. They are demanding another landfill be searched for two murder victims. But Manitoba officials have said picking through the other tip would take years and cost millions, with no guarantee of finding any bodies.  The demonstrators' blockade has forced the city to shut down its Brady landfill. Protesters want the Prairie Green landfill, north of Winnipeg, to be searched because police suspect that waste tip contains the remains of Morgan Beatrice Harris, 39, and Marcedes Myran, 26. Both women, members of the Long Plain First Nation, are among four indigenous women believed to have been killed by Jeremy Skibicki, who was charged last December with four counts of first-degree murder. The city of Winnipeg ordered protesters to dismantle the blockade of the Brady landfill by last Monday. When the demonstrators refused to comply, the city applied for a court injunction, which was granted on Friday. Justice Sheldon Lanchbery said protesters may remain at the site, but they cannot block the road.  Winnipeg police have been given authority to enforce the temporary injunction.  \"What this boils down to is no-one in this province is allowed to block a highway,\" the judge said on Friday. \"This is a public roadway.\" But outside court, the protesters vowed they would not be budged. \"We want our sisters dug up from out the most inappropriate burial site you can think of,\" said Val Vint, reports CBC News. Manitoba Premier Heather Stefanson said she stands by her decision not to search the Prairie Green landfill, citing the health and safety of workers who would have to sift through the debris.  Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller called the decision \"heartless\".  To scour the landfill would take three years and cost up to C$184m ($135m; £109m), according to a study paid for by the federal government.  Such a search would carry \"considerable risks\" because of exposure to toxic chemicals, and there is no guarantee the women would be found, the study concluded. Mr Skibicki is also believed to have killed 24-year-old Rebecca Contois and an unidentified victim who has been given the name Buffalo Woman. Ms Contois' remains were discovered at the Brady landfill in May 2022. Indigenous women in Canada are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than other women, according to a 2019 inquiry.\n",

      "Title: Republicans target corporate diversity programmes\n",
      "Summary: State attorneys general threaten top US companies with legal action over race-based quotas.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66209168\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "More than a dozen Republican state prosecutors have threatened the top 100 US companies with legal action over workforce diversity programmes. They warned corporate targets like \"race-based quotas\" may be unlawful after the Supreme Court banned colleges using affirmative action in admissions. The Republican attorneys general name firms like Apple, Microsoft and Uber. They say \"treating people differently because of the color of their skin, even for benign purposes, is unlawful\". Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach led the effort and signed the letter alongside 11 other attorneys general.  Among the other Fortune 100 companies named in the letter are the likes of Facebook, Airbnb, Paypal, Google, Netflix and Uber. In a statement shared with the BBC, Mr Skrmetti said \"the [Supreme] Court's reasoning means that companies, no matter their motivation, cannot treat people differently based on the color of their skin.  \"Corporate America continues to have many avenues to help disadvantaged people and communities of all races without resorting to crude racial line-drawing.\" The group is pointing to the Supreme Court's landmark ruling that Harvard and other US colleges could no longer consider race as a factor in admissions decisions. Last month, the nation's highest court voted 6-3 to repeal affirmative action, also known as positive discrimination, a decades-old measure in the United States. At the time, Charlotte A Burrows, who was appointed chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by US President Joe Biden, said the ruling \"does not address employer efforts to foster diverse and inclusive workforces or to engage the talents of all qualified workers, regardless of their background\". But some experts had already predicted the ruling would concern legal counsels at corporations. Alvin B Tillery Jr., director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern University, told the BBC he worries \"there will be a chilling effect because of this letter\". He also said there would be repercussions for any companies who roll back diversity policies. \"Young people and young people of colour will punish companies who do not keep these programmes in place, as will their own employees, so this won't be as easy as the college admissions case was,\" he said.  Mr Tillery Jr cited last year's employee walkout at Disney amid the company's silence over a Florida sex education bill as an example of internal pressures corporations can face. But the president of Students for Fair Admissions, Edward Blum, a legal activist who filed the affirmative action case, welcomed the letter from Republican officials. He told the BBC: \"It is long overdue for these practices to be challenged by our nation's legal authorities.\" The BBC has reached out to the companies named in the letter for comment.\n",
