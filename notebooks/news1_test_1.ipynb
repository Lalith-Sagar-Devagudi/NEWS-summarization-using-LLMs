      "Summary: PM Narendra Modi said the assault in Manipur state had \"shamed\" the country.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66253389\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "A video showing two women being paraded naked by a mob in the north-eastern state of Manipur, hit by violent ethnic clashes, has sparked outrage in India. The police say they have opened a case of gang rape and arrested a man, adding that others will be held soon.  On Thursday, parliament's session in Delhi was disrupted as lawmakers demanded a debate on the issue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also said the incident had \"shamed India\" and that \"no guilty will be spared\". \"I assure the nation, the law will take its course with all its might. What happened with the daughters of Manipur can never be forgiven,\" he said, finally breaking his silence on Manipur more than two months after violence erupted.  India video shows how rape is weaponised in conflict Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud also expressed concern over the assault, saying the Supreme Court was \"deeply disturbed over the video\". Telling the government to inform the court about the steps being taken against the accused, the chief justice said \"we will take action if you don't\".  Deadly violence has plunged Manipur, a scenic Indian state bordering Myanmar, into turmoil for more than two months.  Clashes between members of the majority Meitei and the Kuki tribal communities have resulted in their complete segregation. At least 130 people have died and 60,000 have been displaced. The two women, who are Kukis, were assaulted by men of the Meitei group. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing. Police say the assault on the women took place on 4 May but it made national headlines on Thursday after the video started going viral on social media. The federal government has asked all social media companies to delete the video from their platforms.  The horrific video of the two women was widely shared on social media on Wednesday. It shows them being dragged and groped by a mob of men who then push them into a field. The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF) said in a statement that the atrocities had been committed in a village in Kangpokpi district against women from the Kuki-Zo tribal community. It also alleged that the women had been gang raped.  By Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi It's well known that women's bodies often become a battleground during riots and conflicts, and rape and sexual assault are used as instruments of violence to punish them.  The sexual assault of the Kuki women in Manipur is the latest example. The footage showing the women weeping, wincing in pain and begging their attackers to show some mercy is disturbing to watch.  The fact that the first arrest has been made only now, more than two months after the attack was reported to police, does not inspire confidence in the authorities - all the more so since many of the men are clearly identifiable in the footage. But the outrage that followed the video's emergence in India has put the spotlight on the horrific crime. It has also raised questions about the failure of the state in comforting the survivors - and finally forced Mr Modi to make a statement on the ethnic violence that is tearing Manipur apart. To restore some sort of confidence in Manipur, especially among the minority Kuki community, the authorities are now under pressure to act swiftly against the perpetrators and bring justice to the women. People across the country feel this should not be happening in modern India. \"The gang rape of the women happened after the village was burnt down and two men - one middle-aged and another a teenager - were beaten to death by the mob,\" the ITLF said. But the police complaint filed by a relative of one of the women said only one of them was gang raped. It added that a third woman had been forced to strip but she is not seen in the video.  Police said that the incident took place on 4 May and that a case of abduction and gang rape and murder had been registered in Thoubal district.   The assault has been condemned by politicians across the spectrum. Federal minister Smriti Irani, called it \"downright inhuman\". Several opposition leaders also criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party government for not doing enough to quell the violence in the state. Congress party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadhra said that the \"images of sexual violence against women from Manipur are heart wrenching\". Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal weighed in too. \"This kind of heinous act cannot be tolerated in the Indian society,\" he said. BBC News India is now on YouTube.

      "Title: N Korea 'not returning US calls' on missing soldier\n",
      "Summary: The US has reached out to the North, but there is still no word on the whereabouts of Travis King.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66253401\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "North Korea is not responding to attempts to negotiate the release of a US soldier who fled over its heavily-armed border, Washington says. Private Travis King crossed the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) dividing North and South Korea on Tuesday. The Pentagon had contacted North Korea, a state department spokesman said. \"My understanding is those communications have not yet been answered.\"  There has been no word from the North on PV2 King's whereabouts or his fate. The crisis comes during a particularly tense time with the North. Relations with the US have plummeted in recent years, as it has tested dozens of increasingly powerful missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.  On its travel advisory, the US tells its citizens not to travel to North Korea - one of the world's most isolated states - due to \"the continuing serious risk of arrest\" and the \"critical threat of wrongful detention\".  It is unclear if PV2 King has defected or hopes to return.  Experts say such a low-ranking soldier would have little propaganda and intelligence value, which may prompt North Korea into releasing him - but what will happen to him remains highly uncertain.  The lack of precedent makes it hard to foresee next steps - it's been decades since a US soldier last defected to the North. The fact that Pyongyang is not responding to US attempts to communicate is adding to the uncertainty.  PV2 King was due to fly back to the US from South Korea, where he was based, to face disciplinary action. But the 23-year-old did not board the plane when he parted ways with his military escorts at Incheon Airport near Seoul on Tuesday and instead embarked on an apparently pre-booked tour to the border - the details of how he managed to do that are still unclear.  US defence officials said the soldier \"wilfully\" crossed into the North over one of the most heavily-fortified areas in the world.  The DMZ has separated the two countries since the Korean War in the 1950s, in which the US backed the South. The war ended with an armistice, meaning that the two sides are still technically at war. Tens of thousands of US troops remain in the South. Pyongyang could use PV2 King as a propaganda tool to criticise the US military,  said James Fretwell, an analyst at Seoul-based specialist site NK News. \"King may well show up in North Korean state media at some point in the near future. But a lot depends on how long his interrogation, and maybe his Covid-19 quarantine, lasts,\" he added. North Korea still maintains a strict border lockdown in response to the pandemic.  But Jenny Town, director of the Stimson Center's 38 North Program, believes Mr King \"does not make for a very ideal or compelling soldier story\". \"There have also been cases long ago of US soldiers who defected and were allowed to stay… But in those cases, there was political value to [their stories] and it was a very different time, and a different leader,\" she said. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, diplomats and military officials are desperately trying to talk to the North Koreans to find out what is going on, but engaging them is not easy.  State department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US, which has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, has other channels to communicate. He said department officials were engaging with counterparts in South Korea and Sweden to access information on PV2 King - but US officials knew nothing of his current condition or whereabouts. Given that the two countries do not have diplomatic relations, the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang tends to negotiate on behalf of the US. Currently its diplomatic staff are not in the country, because of the ongoing border closure since the pandemic. Both the UN Command, that runs the border area, and the South Korean military have direct phone lines to the North Korean military, that they call daily to check in, though the North Koreans do not always pick up.  In recent years, a number of American citizens who illegally entered North Korea -  excluding those convicted of criminal activity there - have been released within six months.  Some experts feel that the tensions between North Korea and the US and the impasse in bilateral talks means the North has little to gain in holding on to PV2 King.  \"For Pyongyang, it makes sense to find a way of extracting some compensation and then expel an American for unauthorised entry,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \"In the best-case scenario, the American soldier will return home safely at the cost of some propaganda victory for Pyongyang, and US and North Korean officials may have an opportunity to resume dialogue and contacts that went stagnant during the pandemic.\"\n",

      "Title: Wheat prices soar after Russia threatens ships\n",
      "Summary: Russia announces it will treat ships heading for Ukrainian ports as potential military targets.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66253143\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "Wheat prices have risen sharply on global markets after Russia said it would treat ships heading for Ukrainian ports as potential military targets. Moscow pulled out of a UN deal on Monday that ensured safe passage for grain shipments crossing the Black Sea. For the past three nights Russia has bombarded Ukraine's grain facilities in Odesa and other cities. Moscow also warned that from Thursday any ships going there would be seen as siding with \"the Kyiv regime\". White House spokesman Adam Hodge suggested Russia was planning to hit civilian ships and blame Ukraine. Russia had laid more sea mines in the approaches to Ukrainian ports, he said, as part of a co-ordinated Russian effort to justify attacking civilian ships. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to the allegation.  Meanwhile in a similar warning to Russia's, Ukraine has said ships heading towards Russian or occupied ports on the Black Sea could be viewed as carrying military cargo. Wheat prices on the European stock exchange soared by 8.2% on Wednesday from the previous day, to €253.75 (£220; $284) per tonne, while corn prices were up 5.4%. US wheat futures jumped 8.5% - their highest daily rise since just after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Prices in shops will not immediately increase when market prices go up. But if the interruption in supplies leads to a prolonged period of higher prices, the impact will make itself felt around the world in the coming months. The sharp increase in grain cost after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year lead to rising prices - not just for food items based on grains, but also for meat and poultry, as animals are often fed with grain.  Countries which depend most heavily on Ukraine's supplies are likely to be most affected. Before the war Lebanon received nearly three-quarters of its grain from Ukraine, while Pakistan, Libya and Ethiopia are also very heavily dependent.  Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said he would return to the international grain agreement immediately if his demands were met. They include lifting sanctions on sales of Russian grain and fertiliser and reconnecting Russia's agricultural bank to a global payment system. Russian air strikes on the Black Sea coastal cities meanwhile continued for a third night, leaving more than 20 people wounded in Odesa and Mykolaiv.  Mykolaiv regional governor Vitaliy Kim said 19 people had been hurt in the regional capital, including children. Apartment blocks were targeted and in one building the second and top floor were partially destroyed. Several people were also wounded in Odesa, when a four-storey building was badly damaged. Russian-occupied Crimea was also hit overnight, according to its Russian-appointee leader Sergei Aksyonov. A teenage girl was killed when a drone hit four administrative buildings in the north-west of the peninsula. Crimea has been hit on three consecutive days. A suspected Ukrainian drone attack from the sea damaged a bridge from the occupied peninsula to southern Russia on Monday. Part of a key motorway was also shut on Tuesday because of explosions at a nearby munitions depot. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately targeting grain export infrastructure and putting vulnerable countries at risk. Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi said strikes had destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain and damaged considerable parts of the grain export infrastructure. The Black Sea grain deal enabled the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) to ship more than 725,000 tonnes of wheat from Ukraine to countries facing acute hunger, including Ethiopia, Yemen and Afghanistan. So Ukraine provided more than half the WFP's wheat grain last year. More than half the total grain shipped under the deal was corn, however. Of the nearly 33m tonnes exported, the biggest amount went to China (8m tonnes), then Spain (6m tonnes) and Turkey (3.2m tonnes), UN data shows. Turkey has been milling grain into flour for the WFP. Corn is used as biofuel and animal feed, besides human consumption. The defence ministry in Moscow said that from Thursday all vessels sailing on the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports would be regarded as \"potential carriers of military cargo\" and that the ships' \"flag states... will be considered to be involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the side of the Kyiv regime\". On Wednesday Mr Putin accused the West of using the grain deal as \"political blackmail\". Moscow has accused Ukraine of using the Black Sea grain corridor for \"combat purposes\".  Ukraine's options for exporting grain by rail are also very limited: rail capacity is smaller than shipping volumes and several EU countries in Eastern Europe are blocking Ukrainian grain, in order to protect their own farmers. Some Ukrainian grain may now be shipped via the Danube, using Romanian territorial waters, though again the volumes are likely to be relatively small. Marex Capital analyst Charlie Sernatinger said Russia's threatened escalation could \"cut all of the waterborne grain shipments off from the Black Sea, both Russian, and Ukrainian\", which would cause a similar situation to that at the start of the war. Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko called on the UK, US, France and Turkey to protect the grain ships with military convoys and provide Odesa with air defences. \"Clearly Putin has an aim to disrupt food security and cause a peak in world food prices, which in the developed countries will lead to inflation, but in developing countries that will lead to social destabilisation, starvation and new waves of migrants.\" Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n",

      "Title: Xi meets Kissinger as US seeks to defrost China ties\n",
      "Summary: The 100-year-old diplomat's surprise trip to Beijing follows a flurry of visits by US officials.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-66106076\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "Chinese president Xi Jinping has given a warm welcome to former top diplomat Henry Kissinger, as the US pursues closer ties with China. Mr Kissinger's surprise trip to the Chinese capital comes amid a flurry of visits by top US officials. The former secretary of state, who is 100 years old, played a crucial role in helping China emerge from diplomatic isolation in the 1970s. The US has stressed he is visiting in his capacity as a private citizen. But given his outsized stature in China, he could act as a backchannel for US-China negotiations. State television showed Mr Xi smiling as he told Mr Kissinger: \"I'm very glad to see you, sir.\" They met at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, a more intimate space than the sprawling Great Hall of the People where official meetings with foreign diplomats are usually hosted.  Diaoyutai was also the place where, half a century ago, Mr Kissinger met Chinese officials in a secret visit that helped to kick-start the normalisation of US-China ties, noted Mr Xi. \"We will never forget our old friends, and will not forget your historical contributions to develop US-China relations and friendship between the two peoples,\" he added. Mr Xi's affectionate tone mirrored the conciliatory messaging from other top officials who met Mr Kissinger after he touched down on Monday. Chinese statements on his meetings with top diplomat Wang Yi and defence minister Li Shangfu emphasised the need for respect, co-operation and \"peaceful co-existence\" between the two superpowers. The read-outs also quoted Mr Kissinger as saying he was a \"friend of China\", that \"neither the United States nor China can afford to treat the other as an adversary\", and that their relations would be \"central to the peace in the world and to the progress of our society\". Chinese state media have cast Mr Kissinger's visit in a positive light, while on social media many marvelled at Mr Kissinger's stamina, discussing his trip with the Weibo hashtag \"Kissinger can still fly to Beijing for a business trip despite being 100 years old\". But some online also lamented that the US was sending centenarians to promote ties. \"Politicians with great wisdom are getting fewer,\" said one user. A State Department spokesman earlier this week said that they were aware of Mr Kissinger's trip and \"would not be surprised\" if he decided to brief them upon his return.  But they also stressed he was there \"under his own volition\" and not acting on behalf of the US government. As a private citizen, Mr Kissinger can be more frank in his discussions with Mr Xi and other officials, affording him more leeway in presenting US concerns and demands.  It is also less controversial for him to meet figures such as Mr Li, who has been under US sanctions since 2018 for purchasing arms from Russia. Last month Beijing refused to let Mr Li meet his US counterpart Lloyd Austin at a forum in Singapore, citing the sanctions. It may be of little surprise that Mr Kissinger decided to take matters into his own hands with his visit. In an interview in December, Mr Kissinger had criticised the Trump and Biden administrations' approaches to China. He said the current US government was attempting a dialogue that \"usually begins with a statement of Chinese iniquities\" and that discussions were \"stymied\". While Mr Kissinger is no stranger to China - he has visited it more than 100 times and last met Mr Xi in 2019 - this trip comes at a turning point in the US-China relationship. After months of hostility exacerbated by this year's spy balloon incident, diplomatic negotiations appear to be back on track with China welcoming a series of top US officials in the space of a few weeks. Apart from Secretary of State Antony Blinken who visited last month, Mr Kissinger is the only US figure Mr Xi has met in recent weeks - a measure of the respect the veteran diplomat still commands in China. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and US special envoy for climate John Kerry have also paid visits to Beijing, but did not get face time with China's president. With its overtly warm reception of Mr Kissinger, Beijing has clearly signalled it wants more engagement from the US, with Mr Wang saying \"the US' China policy needs Kissinger's diplomatic wisdom and Nixon's political courage\". But this will not change the fact that China will, in the end, stick to its priorities, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University. \"Beijing may potentially consider making token gestures of goodwill after Kissinger's trip both as a thankyou to its friend and boost Kissinger's standing,\" he told the BBC. \"But do not expect it to meaningfully shift the fundamentals driving US-China relations, which will be governed not by individual considerations, but by what Beijing sees as its own national interests.\" Though Mr Kissinger has a controversial reputation in other parts of Asia for his role in the Vietnam War, in China he remains highly regarded for aiding the country's re-engagement with the world. In 1971, while the US and China officially had no ties, Mr Kissinger had paid clandestine visits to Beijing to arrange a trip by then-US President Richard Nixon.  The following year Mr Nixon landed on Chinese soil and met top leaders including Mao Zedong. It paved the way for the normalisation of US-China diplomatic relations and the opening-up of China's economy. Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.\n",

      "Summary: Residents in the south-western outskirts of Berlin are being told to stay indoors.\n",

      "Full Body:\n",
      "Police are searching for an animal they believe is a lioness in the south-western outskirts of Berlin. A police spokeswoman said they received calls and a video alerting them to the wild animal at about midnight on Wednesday, and immediately began their search. At least 30 police cars were deployed, and veterinarians called to assist in the search for the big cat. Residents are being told to stay indoors until it is found. Kleinmachnow Mayor Michael Grubert said authorities have not been able to verify the initial reports of the animal sighting, but it has since been seen by an officer involved in the search.  A video shared on Twitter - which police believe is real - also appeared to show a lioness in a forest in Kleinmachnow. However, it is unclear where the animal came from. Local zoos, animal sanctuaries and circuses said no lions have escaped from their facilities. Police spokesperson Daniel Keip told public broadcaster RBB that \"in the summer you often hear reports of crocodiles in swimming lakes and then it turns out all it was, was a big duck. In this case it's obviously totally real. We're dealing with a lioness that's roaming freely through Teltow, Stahnsdorf and Kleinmachnow.\" But Michel Rogall, a circus director in Teltow who was woken by police at 02:00 local time is not so sure. \"If it's a lion, I'll eat my hat,\" he told the Tagesspiegel newspaper. Residents have been advised to stay indoors and keep their pets with them. Police have also told people to avoid the forest, and seek shelter immediately if they see the lioness. Mr Grubert said authorities were focusing their search on a large area next to a wood where people can walk their dogs. Authorities currently believe the lioness may be sleeping there. Helicopters have been deployed to find the elusive animal as well as drones and heat-seeking cameras, Mr Grubert said. Veterinarians and hunters with tranquiliser guns are also involved in the search.  Mr Grubert, said there was \"no panic, no hysteria... but we do urge people not to go running or cycling in the woods\". Florian Eiserlo of the Four Paws animal welfare organisation told the Rheinische Post newspaper that if anyone runs into the animal, they should not panic. \"Stand still, stay calm, try to head to a safe area such as a car or a building,\" they said.\n",

      "Summary: Former detainees tell the BBC of degrading strip searches which are filmed despite prison rules.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-66258415\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "Former Iranian prisoners of conscience have told the BBC that they were filmed during strip searches in prisons. They also said some detainees were forced to remove their sanitary pad or tampon during their period and squat or squat jump. \"They do this to humiliate us,\" Mozhgan Keshavarz, who spent nearly three years behind bars, mostly in notorious Evin and Qarchak prison in Tehran province, told the BBC. She said she experienced three strip searches in front of security cameras during her incarceration, which ended in January 2022. The third time, a female prison guard took photographs of her naked, she said. When Ms Keshavarz protested, she was told it was necessary to counter future claims of torture. \"Who would see these videos and pictures? Would the regime use them later to silence us?\" she asked, referring to the risk of being blackmailed even when her sentence was over. Ms Keshavarz is a women's rights activist who has protested against the mandatory hijab, or headscarf.  Her Instagram account features a series of artistic images of her without a hijab in a variety of public places. She was accused of \"conspiracy against national security, disrespecting Islam, propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran, and promoting corruption and obscenity\" and sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison. More recently, she has been sentenced for \"corruption on Earth\" - a crime which carries the death penalty - and now lives in exile, from where she spoke to the BBC. Women prisoners have told the BBC that it has long been common practice to strip search drug-related detainees in Iran to look for hidden narcotics. But prisoners of conscience had not previously been typically subjected to it, and certainly not in front of the camera. In early June, Iran's judiciary denied the allegations of filming prisoners, dismissing them as \"hybrid warfare and full-scale Western propaganda against Iran\". However, in mid-June, the head of the judiciary committee in the Iranian parliament said \"only the female guards watch the footage of female prisoners\" - in doing so acknowledging that women prisoners are filmed. It is also alleged that the filming happens in areas where there should not be any cameras. \"According to prison regulations, CCTV is allowed only where prisoners are in motion, like in corridors,\" Mohammad Hossein Aghassi, a practising lawyer in Tehran, told the BBC. The practice of filming strip searches is not unique to Iran - there have been incidents in other countries such as a well-publicised case in the Australian state of New South Wales.  Documents obtained under a freedom of information request revealed that officers routinely filmed searches while they were being conducted.  What is different - and disturbing - about Iran is that our interviewees and many others allege a systematic, intentional practice designed to humiliate the detainees. The BBC has obtained confidential documents from a hacking group called Edaalat Ali, dated November 2021, which contain a letter from the Iranian Judiciary acknowledging one such case of strip searching.  The letter specifically mentions Mojgan Kavoosi, a rights activist for the Kurdish ethnic minority, who was subjected to this practice in a prison in the city of Karaj. A source from within Iran who is familiar with the case told the BBC that Ms Kavoosi was subjected to strip searches on five occasions.  The documents show that after Hrana, a human rights news agency, published a report about her strip search, Iran's prosecutors' office was asked to conduct an investigation into the matter. Ms Kavoosi is now free on bail. Elaheh Ejbari, a rights activist for the Baluch ethnic minority, who now lives in exile, told the BBC that officials \"mocked my body during the strip searches both times I was arrested\". She also showed us a scar on her hand, saying her interrogator had stubbed a cigarette out on her skin. Ms Ejbari was first arrested in September 2020 in Tehran on charges of \"propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran\" and spent six weeks in Evin prison. She was arrested a second time in November 2022 and was kept in an unknown location for three days. After receiving persistent calls from security forces threatening her arrest, she fled Iran.  Nasibe Shamsaei is another Iranian women's rights activist who says she endured strip searches three times. She is one of the Girls of Revolution Street, a group who protested against the compulsory hijab in Iran in 2018 by public removing their headscarves. Dozens were arrested at the time. Accused of a number of crimes including \"propaganda against the Islamic Republic of Iran by removing hijab in public and disrespecting the founder of Islamic Republic of Iran and the Supreme Leader\", Ms Shamsaei was sentenced to 12 years in prison. She was released after almost three months in Qarchak prison, and now lives in exile. She recalls that when she complained about being exposed in front of CCTV cameras, a prison guard responded: \"From now on, everything is possible.\" \n",

      "Summary: Yevgeny Prigozhin says \"there will be no reduction in our programmes\" in the continent.\n",

      "The head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, says they will continue to fight in African countries where they are already present. Ever since Mr Prigozhin mounted a failed mutiny in Russia last month and was banished to Belarus, there have been questions over Wagner's future. \"There was no, and there will be no, reduction in our programmes in Africa,\" Mr Prigozhin told Afrique Média TV. BBC Verify has analysed the audio and confirms it is Mr Prigozhin's voice. He did not appear on camera during the interview with Afrique Média, which is a pro-Kremlin news channel that targets French-speaking African countries and has been linked to the Wagner group. Mr Prigozhin's soldiers are embedded in countries including Mali and the Central African Republic (CAR) - where rights groups and the UN accuse them of committing war crimes. The UK on Thursday announced sanctions against 13 individuals and businesses linked to the Wagner Group, accusing them of executions and torture in Mali and CAR and threats to peace and security in Sudan. They include the heads of Wagner's operations in Mali, Ivan Aleksandrovitch Maslov and in CAR, Konstantin Aleksandrovitch Pikalov. Wagner fighters are also accused by the US of enriching themselves with illicit gold deals on the continent. But Mr Prigozhin insists their work is of a different nature. \"We continue to work in all the countries where we started or are now doing this work of co-operation and development,\" he told Afrique Média TV. \"If the assistance of the Wagner Group is needed anywhere to combat gangs and terrorists and to protect the interests of the people of these countries, we are ready to begin immediately to fulfil this task after agreeing on the conditions.\" The Wagner boss' comments echo those of Russia's foreign minister, who has said that despite recent events, Wagner and Russia were in Africa to stay.\n",

      "One winning US lottery ticket was sold for Wednesday night's Powerball jackpot of $1.08bn (£837m), lottery officials announced. The winning ticket was bought at the Las Palmitas Mini Market in Los Angeles. The Powerball ticket matched all six numbers required to score the jackpot - 7, 10, 11, 13 and 24, with a Powerball of 24. The odds of winning the jackpot are one in 292.2 million, Powerball says. It is unclear whether the winning ticket holder has claimed the prize. When claimed, they have the option of receiving the full amount of $1.08bn in an annuity paid over three decades, or they can take a smaller cash option as a lump sum.  However, almost all winners opt for the up-front cash option, which in this case has a value of $558.1m before taxes. Powerball said final ticket sales pushed the jackpot beyond its earlier estimate of $1bn to $1.08bn at the time of the draw. \"This has turned into a historic jackpot run; this is only the third time in Powerball's 31-year history that a jackpot has reached the billion-dollar threshold,\" said Drew Svitko, Powerball product group chair and Pennsylvania Lottery executive director. No one had won the Powerball or its competing lottery, Mega Millions, since April. Both prizes rose to some of their highest amounts ever in recent weeks. A Mega Millions draw for $720m is due on Friday. The last time someone won the Powerball jackpot before Wednesday's draw was on 19 April for a top prize of nearly $253m.  Powerball holds the current world record for the largest national lottery jackpot. A record prize was won in November by California resident Edwin Castro, who was the sole winner of the $2.05bn prize, according to the Guinness World Records. In May, a fellow Californian sued Mr Castro, claiming the lucky ticket was stolen from him. The California Lottery has maintained that it is confident Mr Castro is the rightful winner.\n",

      "Full Body:\n",
      "Apple says it will remove services such as FaceTime and iMessage from the UK rather than weaken security if new proposals are made law and acted upon. The government is seeking to update the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) 2016. It wants messaging services to clear security features with the Home Office before releasing them to customers. The act lets the Home Office demand security features are disabled, without telling the public. Under the update, this would have to be immediate. Currently, there has to be a review, there can also be an independent oversight process and a technology company can appeal before taking any action. Because of the secrecy surrounding these demands, little is known about how many have been issued and whether they have been complied with.  But many messaging services currently offer end-to-end encryption - so messages can be unscrambled by only the devices sending and receiving them. WhatsApp and Signal are among the platforms to have opposed a clause in the Online Safety Bill allowing the communications regulator to require companies to install technology to scan for child-abuse material in encrypted messaging apps and other services. They will not comply with it, they say, with Signal threatening to \"walk\" from the UK. Apple has also opposed the plan. The government has opened an eight-week consultation on the proposed amendments to the IPA., which already enables the storage of internet browsing records for 12 months and authorises the bulk collection of personal data. They are \"not about the creation of new powers\" but making the act more relevant to current technology, it says. Apple has consistently opposed the act, originally dubbed a \"snooper's charter\" by critics. Its submission to the current consultation is nine pages long, opposing: Apple says: Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, said technology companies were unlikely to accept the proposals. \"There is a degree of arrogance and ignorance from the government if they believe some of the larger tech companies will comply with the new requirements without a major fight,\" he added.

      "Summary: The Australian dementia patient died after she was allegedly tasered by a police officer in May.\n",
      "Link: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-66229582\n",
      "Full Body:\n",
      "An Australian police officer charged with tasering a 95-year-old care home resident acted in a \"grossly disproportionate\" way, prosecutors in the case say. Clare Nowland died in May, a week after the incident which was prompted when she was found holding two knives.  New court documents allege Kristian White said \"bugger it\" before firing as she slowly advanced using a walker. He is yet to enter a plea on grievous bodily harm and assault charges. Details of the incident in the town of Cooma - about 114km (71 miles) south of Canberra - have been outlined for the first time in police facts tendered to court. Just after 03:00 local time on 17 May, Ms Nowland was spotted walking along a corridor in Yallambee Lodge while holding two knives.  Twice, the dementia patient was asked by a nurse to drop the knives, police say, to which she replied \"no\".  She was later found holding them while standing inside another resident's room. After failing to reach Ms Nowland's family, staff called emergency services with the intention of having an ambulance come to sedate her, the police facts say. It was around that time that workers allege the dementia patient threw a knife at one of her carers.  After police and ambulance workers arrived on the scene, Ms Nowland began moving \"very slowly\" on her walker towards them with the remaining knife raised.  Mr White asked Ms Nowland to drop the knife and stop moving four times before discharging his weapon from 1.5-2m (4.92-6.5 feet) away, police allege. The senior constable also warned her that he was pointing a taser at her chest. \"Clare, stop now, see this, this is a taser, drop it now, drop it, this is your first warning,\" he said, according to the documents. Ms Nowland suffered a fractured skull and a serious brain bleed from falling and hitting her head after she was tasered. Prosecutors say Mr White - who has been suspended from duty without pay pending the outcome of the criminal investigation - used \"excessive force\" given Ms Nowland's age and physical state. Police procedures dictate that a taser \"should not be used against an elderly or disabled subject unless exceptional circumstances exist\", the documents added.  The Nowland family have asked for \"privacy and space\" while they digest the police facts, according to a statement released by their lawyer.  \"The facts alleged against Mr White are extremely confronting and shocking,\" it said. Kristian White - who is on bail - is due to appear before a Cooma court again on 6 September.\n",

      "South African authorities are concerned there could be a second explosion in Johannesburg's business district, after one person died and 48 were injured in a large blast on Wednesday. Videos show a main road split wide open from the force of the explosion, with several vehicles blown onto their side. It is still unclear what led to the blast, but officials suspect an underground gas pipe is responsible. Officials have pleaded with the public to stay clear of the area.  The scene at Bree Street is still being treated as a potential risk area - emergency services remain there and people are being evacuated where necessary. Several streets have been closed to traffic and electricity supply in the area has been sealed off, in what is usually one of the busiest parts of South Africa's commercial hub. Officials from Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg, suspect the blast may have been caused when some underground gas pipes ruptured. Addressing the media on Thursday, Premier Panyaza Lesufi said 12 people are still being treated in hospital for their injuries. A preliminary inquiry did not establish the cause of the blast and investigations are underway to determine what happened, he told reporters. Local supplier Egoli Gas said on Thursday that they had found a small leak in one of their pipes, but they believe it is unlikely that it led to the explosion.  The firm has been asked by authorities to check on their other pipes in the area, as a possible gas leak still the focus of investigations.  On Wednesday evening, witnesses reported feeling the ground shake then hearing a loud bang moments before the earth opened, and a section of Bree Street collapsed.\n",
